The heapsort benchmark program takes two arguments in terminal:
arg1: number of elements in array
arg2: number of times to run the sorting algorithm
-With an array size of 10000, the logfile generated will have a size of about 450MB.


To run the correctness traces set the l1 data cache size to 4 bytes, associativity(setsize) to 1 and block size to 4.
-Test read expects a miss rate of 50%.
