    <h1>Assignment 2</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>In this assignment you will implement a map ADT whose interface
    we have specified for you.  A map associates values with keys.
    The operations to be supported by maps are:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a new, empty map.  (map_create)</li>
      <li>Destroying a may.  (map_destroy)</li>
      <li>Mapping a key to an associated value.  (map_put)</li>
      <li>Checking whether some key exists.  (map_haskey)</li>
      <li>Retrieving the value associated with some key.  (map_get)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There should be no bound on the number of elements that may be
    inserted into the map, short of running out of memory.</p>

    <h2>Algorithms</h2>
    
    <p>The implementation of the map ADT is intended to be based on
    hashing, as evidenced by the specified map_create() function,
    which accepts both a comparison function and a hash function.
    These functions specify how keys in the map are to be compared and
    hashed, respectively.  The main implementation questions are how
    to deal with collisions (i.e. when two inequal keys have equal hash
    values) and how to grow the capacity of the map as needed.</p>

    <h2>Applications</h2>

    <p>To test your implementation, you will implement a simple
    utility program called <i>wordfreqs</i>.  The program should
    tokenize a set of input files into a sequence of words, and
    proceed to print all unique words, along with the number of times
    they occur.  The most common word should be listed first, followed
    by the second most common word, and so on.  The input files to
    process should be specifed on the command-line, like this:</p>

    <p>./wordfreqs sometextfile someothertextfile ...<p>

    <p>One way to implement this would be to use a map that maps each
    word to its frequency of occurrence, while keeping a separate list
    of unique words.  When all words have been read, the list of
    unique words may be sorted in order of descending word
    frequencies.</p>

    <h2>Code</h2>

    <p>Your starting point is the following set of files:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>list.h - Specifies the interface of
      the list ADT from the first assignment.</li>

      <li>linkedlist.c - An
      implementation of the list ADT based on doubly-linked
      lists.</li>

      <li>map.h- Specifies the interface of
      the map ADT.  Do not modify this file.</li>

      <li>common.h - Defines utility
      functions for your convenience.  There are two additions since
      the previous assignment; a typedef for hash functions, and a
      function hash_string() which may be used to hash null-terminated
      strings.</li>

      <li>common.c - Implements the
      functions defined in common.h.</li>

      <li>wordfreqs.c - An empty stub for
      the wordfreqs program (complete this).</li>

      <li>Makefile - A Makefile for
      compiling the code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As in the first assignment (list ADT), you need to add
    a new source file that implements your map ADT. Edit the name of this
    source file into the Makefile, as the value of the MAP_SRC variable.</p>

    <p>We've bundled all of the source code in a zip
    file. The zip file is located in the same
    folder as this document (p2-pre.zip).</p>

    <h2>Deadline</h2>
 

    <p>This assignment is not mandatory.  However, we highly recommend
    you to complete it. </p>
